# Stock-Analysis-Algorithm
This project implements a Java-based stock trading backtester. The algorithm simulates trades (both long and short) under different riskFactor settings and calculates performance statistics such as average profit, holding period, and winning percentage.

# How It Works
The algorithm takes in historical stock price data.
A parameter called riskFactor controls how aggressively the strategy enters and holds trades.
A lower riskFactor = shorter holding period, faster trades.
A higher riskFactor = longer holding period, fewer but larger trades.
For each simulation, the program outputs key statistics:
- Total trades executed
- Average profit per trade
- Average holding period (in days)
- Average profit per day
- Winning percentage (percentage of trades that were profitable)
- Separate breakdown for long trades and short trades
